**commit**     : [bf8637f418298af596974c49eb58d2253195bfc9](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/commit/bf8637f418298af596974c49eb58d2253195bfc9)  
**pr**         : [38708](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/pull/38708)  
**description**:  
Fixed a bug in [preconnecting](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.33.2/api-v3/config/cluster/v3/cluster.proto.html#envoy-v3-api-msg-config-cluster-v3-cluster-preconnectpolicy) where established connection unused capacity was not considered in the logic to establish new connections, resulting in new connections anytime there was not a connection currently in the process of being established. This resulted in far too many connections being established, with the only bounds being cluster circuit breaker limits or upstream service limits.
